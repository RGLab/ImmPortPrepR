# OVERVIEW
The purpose of this vignette is to demonstrate how to use the functions and data in the `import2ImmPort` package to
create the basicStudyDesign.csv that must be submitted along with assay and other metaData to the public ImmPort 
database at NIH.

First, we will load the `import2ImmPort` library, which has the functions and data we need.
```{r load-library}
library(Import2ImmPort)
```

Next, we need to create the 9 dataframes that will be put together to form the larger csv.  

The first dataframe, called *study* is unique in that it has two columns, one with header names and the other with 
information for the corresponding header.  In this way it functions more like a named list and is treated differently 
from most other dataframes that have a typical format with column headers and unlimited rows allowed.
```{r create-study-df}

```
